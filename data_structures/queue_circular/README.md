# Queue

	A queue is a data structure to store elements in a FIFO way (First In, First Out).
	Items are always added at the end of the queue and removed at the beginning (front).

# Implementation
	
	This is a dynamic circular queue. It solves the
	memory problems that the static queue has. It's 
	a very elegant solution, with very easy to implement
	functions.
