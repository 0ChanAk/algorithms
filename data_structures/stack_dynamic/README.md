# Stack

A Stack is a special type of linked list. 
Insertions and remotions take place at the same extreme of the list, called 'top'.

# How does it work?

This is a static implementation of a stack. Which means the stack is 
made out of a vector with a max size and a counter, which keeps track 
of the stack size. 

Enjoy!
